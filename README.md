Python Pair Programming for Week 1-3 - Analysis on Scikit Learn California Housing Dataset

This purpose of this submission was to formulate a business question, and address the problem statement with data analysis conducted using Python.

Business Question
A real estate agent of California area with a collection of 20,640 samples of housing data consisting of 8 numeric attributes is unaware of how to analyse and visualise the data he posseses. He requests for assistance on analysis of key features influencing sale of properties to efficiently pitch the ideal house to buyers.

In this notebook, we attempt at aiding our primary business stakeholder, the real estate agents of California area to analyse which attributes have the most impact on the Median House Value. This will better help them to appropriately pitch the available property to interested buyers.

Action Plan
Analyse the california housing data and study its features.
Calculate summary statistics of attributes and check if pre-process of data is required.
Pre-process and clean data to be used and observe (if applicable).
Understand the relation between the independent and dependent variables by plotting necessary graphs.
Draw conclusions on key attributes influencing the target variable
Linear Regression Model Fit (R Squared Score) to ensure the data being used is worth investigating.
